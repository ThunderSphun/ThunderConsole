# The ThunderConsole concept

This repo is meant for me to create a fictional video game home console.  
This console is inspired by the game consoles from the 80s and 90s, like these:

- NES  
- SNES  
- GameBoy  
- GBC  
- GBA  

As I am most familiar with the mos6502 and its variations, the console will have a processor that likely will have some similarities to that chip.

The idea for this console is not that it is handheld, but connected to the television at home.  
For now this console is just hypothetical, but I plan on eventually making an emulator for this, so that it can actually be tested and games could be made for it.
